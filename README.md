# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
It is an intelligent device which can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction.We used an Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor to build an Obstacle Avoider. Here an Ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the obstacles in the path by calculating the distance between the robot and obstacle. If robot finds any obstacle it changes the direction and continue moving.
